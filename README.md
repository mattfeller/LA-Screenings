# LA-Screenings
Python code to find screenings in LA for given Letterboxd lists.

Because it uses fuzzy string matching, there are some false positives. For example, when I ran it, "Frances Ha" and "Hoop Dreams" show up, but were not on the lists I provided.

I don't think there are any movies from the Letterboxd lists which were wrongfully excluded. However, it does not seem that Revival Hub itself is perfect, because I know of two upcoming movies from the American Cinematheque which are not showing up. So, if you have any favorite theaters it is still worth browsing their calendars manually.
